I love everything about you from Your laugh to smile to your personality. I am not good at expressing my feelings but i am trying my hardest just to get you understand how much i really do love and care for you. although i dont think you will ever know how much i really do love and care for you. You are the perfect person for me i can be myself around you all the time and not have to worry that will make you feel diffrently about me.Our paths crossed for a reason and that reason was because we were meant to be together.I am so glad i am with you and no one else no else could be as perfect as you are. You support me through my struggles and are there for me as soon as i suceed. Once again there is no one as perfect as you are. I love you.</p>

            <p>O my Luve is like a red, red rose 
                Thats newly sprung in June; 
                O my Luve is like the melody 
                Thats sweetly played in tune.  So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
                So deep in luve am I; 
                And I will luve thee still, 
                my dear,Till a the seas gang dry. </p>
